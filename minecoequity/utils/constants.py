<strong>WHAT IS CRYPTOCURRENCY MINING?</strong>

Most people think of crypto mining simply as a way of creating new coins. Crypto mining, however, also involves validating cryptocurrency transactions on a blockchain network and adding them to a distributed ledger. Most importantly, crypto mining prevents the double-spending of digital currency on a distributed network.

Like physical currencies, when one member spends cryptocurrency, the digital ledger must be updated by debiting one account and crediting the other. However, the challenge of a digital currency is that digital platforms are easily manipulated.

Bitcoin's distributed ledger, therefore, only allows verified miners to update transactions on the digital ledger. This gives miners the extra responsibility of securing the network from double-spending.

Meanwhile, new coins are generated to reward miners for their work in securing the network. Since distributed ledgers lack a centralized authority, the mining process is crucial for validating transactions. Miners are, therefore, incentivized to secure the network by participating in the transaction validation process that increases their chances of winning newly minted coins.




<strong>DIFFERENT METHODS OF MINING CRYPTOCURRENCIES</strong>

Different methods of mining cryptocurrencies require different amounts of time. In the technology's early days, for example, CPU mining was the go-to option for most miners. However, many find CPU mining to be too slow and impractical today because it takes months to accrue even a small amount of profit, given the high electrical and cooling costs and increased difficulty across the board.

GPU mining is another method of mining cryptocurrencies. It maximizes computational power by bringing together a set of GPUs under one mining rig. For GPU mining, a motherboard and cooling system is required for the rig.

Similarly, ASIC mining is yet another method of mining cryptocurrencies. Unlike GPU miners, ASIC miners are specifically designed to mine cryptocurrencies, so they produce more cryptocurrency units than GPUs. However, they are expensive, meaning that, as mining difficulty increases, they quickly become obsolete.




<strong>WHAT IS THE MINING PROCESS LIKE</strong>

Mining is a complex process, but in a nutshell, transactions are entered into blocks on the blockchain. The block is assigned some information, and all of the data in the block is put through a cryptographic algorithm (called "hashing"). It gets a 64-digit hexadecimal number (called a hash), which is part of what miners are solving for.

The Hash
Here is an example of a hash:
<pre>0000000000000000057fcc708cf0130d95e27c5819203e9f967ac56e4df598ee</pre>

The number above has 64 digits. As you probably noticed, that number consists not just of numbers but also letters. Why is that?

The decimal system uses factors of 100 as its base (e.g., 1% = 0.01). This, in turn, means that every digit of a multi-digit number has 100 possibilities, zero through 99. In computing, the decimal system is simplified to base 10, or zero through nine.

"Hexadecimal," on the other hand, means base 16 because "hex" is derived from the Greek word for six, and "deca" is derived from the Greek word for 10. In a hexadecimal system, each digit has 16 possibilities. But our numeric system only offers 10 ways of representing numbers (zero through nine). That's why you have to add letters-specifically, the letters A, B, C, D, E, and F.




<strong>WHY DOES MINING USE SO MUCH ELECTRICTY</strong>

In the early days of Bitcoin, anybody could simply run a mining program from their PC or laptop. But as the network grew and more people became interested in mining, the algorithm became more difficult. This is because the code for Bitcoin targets finding a new block once every 10 minutes, on average. If more miners are involved, the chances that somebody will solve the hash quicker increases, so the difficulty increases to restore that 10-minute goal. Now imagine if thousands, or even millions more times that mining power joins the network. That's a lot of new machines consuming energy.
